/**
 * @dev Test-only attacker that triggers a cross-function reentrancy in
 * `ERC20ConfidentialLib._moveAndCall`.
 *
 * `_moveAndCall` commits the recipient credit (and grants it ACL on the new
 * balance handle) in its forward leg BEFORE invoking this callback, and only
 * afterwards runs a *saturating* refund leg if the callback returns `false`.
 *
 * This receiver exploits that ordering: during the callback it re-enters the
 * token via `confidentialTransfer` and sweeps the just-received balance to
 * `attacker`, then returns `false` to request a refund. When the refund leg
 * tries to debit this contract, its balance is already 0, so the saturating
 * `trySpend` is a no-op — nothing is clawed back. Net result: the sender is
 * debited, the refund returns nothing, and `attacker` keeps the funds.
