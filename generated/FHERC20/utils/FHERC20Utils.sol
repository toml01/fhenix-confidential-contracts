     * function should try to refund the `from` address.

     * Both encrypted values crossing this boundary are directed shares (see {IERC7984Receiver}):
     * `amount` is shared to `to`, and the returned flag is consumed with
     * `receiveEboolFromCall(_, to)` so that only a value `to` itself handed back is accepted.
     * Returns a plain `ebool` so callers are unaffected by the boundary's typing.
