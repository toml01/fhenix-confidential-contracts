/**
 * Deploys AND VERIFIES ERC20ConfidentialLib - the shared confidential engine.
 *
 * Deploy ONCE PER CHAIN; every confidential token (thin hosts, wrappers, Core-based products)
 * links against this single instance. Idempotent: hardhat-deploy skips the deployment when the
 * library is already deployed on the target network with identical bytecode, and records the
 * address in `deployments/<network>/ERC20ConfidentialLib.json` - that file is the on-repo
 * address registry that later deploy scripts (and frontends) read. COMMIT IT.
 *
 * Verification is FORCED on live networks: the script refuses to deploy unless
 * `ETHERSCAN_MAINNET_API_KEY` is set in the environment (users must be able to read the
 * library code on the block explorer), and verifies right after deployment. On dev networks
 * (hardhat/localhost) verification is skipped. If verification fails after a successful
 * deployment, the script exits with an error - re-running it retries verification only
 * (the deployment itself is skipped as already done).
 *
 *   ETHERSCAN_MAINNET_API_KEY=... npx hardhat deploy --network <network> --tags ERC20ConfidentialLib
 *
 * NOTE: the library's compiler settings are pinned in hardhat.config.ts (0.8.26, optimizer
 * runs:1) so this artifact reproduces the bytecode of the library instances already live on
 * chain. Don't retune those settings without redeploying and re-verifying.
 *
 * How a token links against it (the address is baked into the token's BYTECODE at deploy
 * time - it is not a constructor argument and cannot change afterwards):
 *
 *   // hardhat-deploy style (in a later deploy script):
 *   const lib = await deployments.get("ERC20ConfidentialLib");
 *   await deploy("MyConfidentialToken", {
 *     from: deployer,
 *     args: [...],
 *     libraries: { ERC20ConfidentialLib: lib.address },
 *   });
 *
 *   // plain ethers style (tests / scripts):
 *   const factory = await ethers.getContractFactory("MyConfidentialToken", {
 *     libraries: { "generated/ERC20Confidential/ERC20ConfidentialLib.sol:ERC20ConfidentialLib": lib.address },
 *   });
 *
 *   // OZ upgrades plugin (upgradeable tokens):
 *   await upgrades.deployProxy(factory, [...], { unsafeAllowLinkedLibraries: true });
