## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 3ecb00c: Move the remaining confidential boundary values onto the `sharedEuintXX` types, and pair `inputProof` with the handles it authenticates.

  **Breaking, and invisible to the compiler.** `euint64`, `externalEuint64` and `sharedEuint64` are all `bytes32` on the wire, so every selector below is unchanged. Existing callers keep compiling and fail at runtime with `NotShared`.

  - The `bytes32` overloads of `confidentialTransfer`, `confidentialTransferFrom`, `confidentialTransferAndCall`, `confidentialTransferFromAndCall` and `unshield` now take `sharedEuint64`. Callers must produce the value with `FHE.shareEuint64(handle, token)`; the `isAllowed` guard is replaced by the share check, which establishes provenance rather than possession. These entry points are consequently reachable only from a contract — an EOA cannot create a share, and should use the `externalEuint64 + inputProof` overload, which is unchanged.
  - Those functions, plus `shield`, `shieldNative`, `shieldWrappedNative` and both `unshield` overloads, now return `sharedEuint64` instead of a bare handle with an `allowTransient` grant. Contract callers must consume the result with `FHE.receiveEuint64FromCall(returned, token)`, naming the address called in the same expression.
  - On the four `*AndCall` overloads `inputProof` now precedes `bytes data`, immediately after the handle it authenticates. This is the ordering `@cofhe/abi` 0.7.0 requires: it locates the batch signature in the plain `bytes` following the contiguous run of `external*` inputs. Against the older pre-0.7 helper, which required that `bytes` in the _final_ slot, the two `bytes` arguments swap meaning silently — neither version throws on the wrong ordering, because the wrong parameter is also `bytes`. Callers must be on `@cofhe/*` 0.7.0.

  `ERC20ConfidentialUnauthorizedUseOfEncryptedAmount` is removed from both `ERC20ConfidentialLib` and `ERC20ConfidentialCoreUpgradeable`: no code path throws it once the share check replaces the `isAllowed` guards. `FHERC20UnauthorizedUseOfEncryptedAmount` stays — `requestDiscloseEncryptedAmount` still throws it, and keeps its `isAllowed` guard because there is no share to consume there.

- 0e57fb6: Add `FHESafeMath.trySpend` and route the confidential debit path through it, cutting one FHE operation from every transfer.

  The debit leg used to run two selects for one decision: `tryDecrease` selected between the old and new balance, then the call site re-derived the moved amount with a second `FHE.select(success, amount, 0)`. `trySpend` returns the debited amount alongside the updated balance, so the caller reads it off the debit instead of recomputing it — and selecting the delta first lets a single `FHE.sub` replace `tryDecrease`'s `FHE.sub` + `FHE.select` pair:

  ```solidity
  success = FHE.gte(balance, amount);
  spent   = FHE.select(success, amount, FHE.asEuint64(0));
  updated = FHE.sub(balance, spent); // `spent` fits by construction, so this cannot underflow
  ```

  Six FHE tasks per transfer become five (`gte`, `trivialEncrypt`, `select`, `sub`, `add`), which measures as ~121k gas saved per confidential transfer against the mock coprocessor (`ERC20Confidential` 986,873 → 865,224; base `FHERC20` 976,880 → 855,409, both ~12%). `confidentialTransferAndCall` runs two debits and saves twice.

  Semantics are unchanged: the debit is still all-or-nothing, so an over-balance transfer moves nothing rather than partially draining the sender, and `spent` is always an initialized, caller-owned handle that is safe to `FHE.allow`.

  `tryDecrease`, `tryIncrease`, `tryAdd`, and `trySub` are untouched, so nothing downstream breaks — `trySpend` is purely additive. `tryDecrease` now has no in-repo call sites and remains only as published API.

- 8f93eb7: Migrate to `@cofhe/*` 0.7 and `@fhenixprotocol/cofhe-contracts` 0.2.x (batch input verification).

  `cofhe-contracts` 0.2.x deletes the `InEuintXX` structs and the `FHE.asEuint64(InEuint64)` overload. The per-ciphertext signature that the struct used to carry is replaced by one signature per batch, passed as a trailing `bytes` parameter.

  Breaking changes:

  - **Every function taking an encrypted input changed shape.** `InEuint64 memory encryptedAmount` becomes `externalEuint64 encryptedAmount, bytes calldata inputProof`, across `IERC7984`, `IERC20ConfidentialCore`, `FHERC20Core`, `ERC20ConfidentialCoreUpgradeable` and `ERC20ConfidentialLib`. On the wire the struct tuple `(uint256,uint8,uint8,bytes)` becomes `bytes32,bytes`, so callers selecting overloads by signature string must be updated.
  - **The `*AndCall` overloads gained a second `bytes` parameter**: `confidentialTransferAndCall(address,bytes32,bytes,bytes)`. `inputProof` sits immediately after the handle it authenticates, ahead of `bytes data` — `@cofhe/abi` locates the batch signature in the plain `bytes` following the contiguous run of `external*` inputs (cofhesdk changeset `proof-follows-hash`). Callers selecting this overload by signature string get an unchanged selector, so the two `bytes` arguments must be ordered by hand.
  - **`ERC20ConfidentialLib` must be redeployed and every host relinked.** Its ABI changed, so this build is not interchangeable with library instances deployed before 0.7.
  - **Callers must name the consuming contract before encrypting.** `client.encryptInputs([...])` now requires `.setConsumingContract(address)` before `.execute()`, and `execute()` returns `[...hashes, signature]` rather than one struct per value. The verifier binds the consuming contract into the signed digest, so a batch signed for one contract cannot be replayed into another.
  - **The `@cofhe/*` packages are on `0.7.0`.** `@fhenixprotocol/cofhe-contracts` stays pinned to `0.2.0-beta.3`: the 0.2.x line is what carries `externalEuint64` / `sharedEuint64`, and it has no stable release yet (`latest` is still 0.1.5). Confirm that pin before publishing this package.

  The move onto the `sharedEuintXX` types for encrypted values crossing a contract boundary is tracked separately, in its own changeset in this release.

- 8a69d1b: Move the transfer-callback boundary onto the `sharedEuintXX` types.

  `IERC7984Receiver.onConfidentialTransferReceived` previously took a bare `euint64` and returned a bare `ebool`, with permission granted out of band via `FHE.allowTransient`. On a callback that cannot authenticate its caller, that is a decryption oracle: FHE operations check the permission of the _contract_ performing them, so any caller could pass any handle the receiver is allowed on (including the receiver's own stored state) and read back a value derived from it.

  Breaking change:

  - **`IERC7984Receiver.onConfidentialTransferReceived` now takes `sharedEuint64` and returns `sharedEbool`.** Both are `bytes32` on the wire, so existing receivers keep compiling against the old signature and fail at runtime with `NotShared`. Every receiver must migrate in the same change.

  Implementers must unwrap the amount with `FHE.receiveEuint64Param(amount)`, which requires the sharer to be `msg.sender`, and return `FHE.shareEbool(result, msg.sender)` instead of granting the token access with `FHE.allowTransient`. A received handle carries transient access only; persisting it past the transaction requires `FHE.allowThis` on the unwrapped `euint64`.

  `FHERC20Utils.checkOnTransferReceived` still returns a plain `ebool`, so callers inside the token are unaffected.

  This scoped out the ERC-7984 user-facing entry points, which kept accepting bare handles guarded by `FHE.isAllowed(value, msg.sender)`. That is superseded within this same release — see the changeset that moves the remaining boundary values onto `sharedEuintXX`. Wallet callers use the `externalEuint64 + inputProof` overload, which is unaffected either way.

- eb318a7: Split the confidential layer into shared cores plus an external linked library, so hosts fit under EIP-170.

  All FHE orchestration now lives in `ERC20ConfidentialLib`, an external library that must be deployed once per chain and linked into every consuming token. The logic that `FHERC20`/`FHERC20Upgradeable` and the two wrapper pairs each carried a full copy of moved into shared cores (`FHERC20Core`, `FHERC20ERC20WrapperCore`, `FHERC20NativeWrapperCore`, `ERC20ConfidentialCoreUpgradeable`), leaving the existing contracts as thin hosts.

  Breaking changes:

  - **Library linking is now mandatory.** Deploy `ERC20ConfidentialLib` and pass it via `libraries` when building any token factory (`unsafeAllowLinkedLibraries: true` for the OZ upgrades plugin). See the README.
  - **Unshield claims are re-keyed.** `claimUnshielded` and `getClaim` take a unique per-claimant id (`keccak256(to, nonce++, handle)`), not the ciphertext handle, which fixes claims with colliding handles overwriting each other. The `Claim` struct gains `id` and drops `requestedAmount`; `decryptedAmount` now holds the proven settle amount. Pending claims do NOT survive an upgrade from the old `FHERC20WrapperClaimHelper` store, so settle them before upgrading a proxy.
  - **`FHERC20WrapperClaimHelper` and `FHERC20WrapperClaimHelperUpgradeable` are removed**, replaced by `FHERC20WrapperClaims` over the library's claim store.
  - **`confidentialTotalSupply()` now returns a real registered, publicly-decryptable ciphertext** instead of an unregistered handle wrapping a plaintext. New `confidentialTotalSupplyPlaintext()` and permissionless `syncConfidentialTotalSupply()` accompany it; the plaintext saturates at `type(uint64).max` rather than reverting, so a donation to the confidential pool cannot brick shield or deadlock claims.
  - **Confidential moves are now `nonReentrant`**, which rejects reentrant callbacks that previously succeeded.
  - **`ERC20Confidential` and `ERC20ConfidentialUpgradeable` no longer nominally inherit `IERC20Confidential`** (the `IERC7984`/`IERC20ConfidentialCore` trees declare overlapping events, which Solidity rejects in one graph). The full ABI is unchanged and `supportsInterface` still answers for it.

  Additions: a `_beforeConfidentialMove` policy hook for freeze/pause, an optional compliance observer, and `shieldTo`/`autoShield` with the `MintMode`/`IMintModePolicy` opt-in policy surface for hosts that want freshly minted tokens auto-shielded.

  - `FHERC20.supportsInterface` now reports `IFHERC20`, `IERC7984`, `IERC20`, and `ERC165`

## 0.2.1

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 485a425: Rename wrap/unwrap → shield/unshield; add FHERC20WrappedNative and decimal precision

  ### Breaking changes

  - `FHERC20Wrapper` renamed to `FHERC20WrappedERC20` (file renamed to `FHERC20WrappedERC20.sol`).
  - `FHERC20UnwrapClaim` renamed to `FHERC20UnshieldClaim` (file renamed to `FHERC20UnshieldClaim.sol`).
  - All `wrap` / `unwrap` / `claimUnwrapped` / `claimUnwrappedBatch` functions renamed to `shield` / `unshield` / `claimUnshielded` / `claimUnshieldedBatch`.
  - Events renamed: `WrappedERC20` → `ShieldedERC20`, `UnwrappedERC20` → `UnshieldedERC20`, `ClaimedUnwrappedERC20` → `ClaimedUnshieldedERC20`.
  - `FHERC20WrappedERC20.decimals()` now reports the **confidential precision** (capped at 6) rather than the underlying token's decimals.
  - `shield` now accepts the raw underlying ERC20 amount (not a pre-scaled confidential amount). Amounts are aligned to `_conversionRate` automatically; any remainder is not transferred. Reverts with `AmountTooSmallForConfidentialPrecision` if the aligned amount is zero.
  - `unshield` now accepts amounts in confidential units (6-decimal precision). Claims are returned in underlying ERC20 units scaled by `_conversionRate`.

  ### New features

  - **`FHERC20WrappedNative`** — confidential wrapper for a chain's native token (e.g. ETH). Supports two shield entry-points:
    - `shieldWrappedNative(address to, uint256 value)` — pulls WETH from the caller, unwraps it to native ETH, and mints confidential tokens.
    - `shieldNative(address to) payable` — accepts native ETH directly; dust below the `conversionRate` is automatically refunded to the caller.
    - `unshield`, `claimUnshielded`, and `claimUnshieldedBatch` send native ETH to the recipient on claim.
  - **`_conversionRate`** immutable added to `FHERC20WrappedERC20` — computed as `10^(underlyingDecimals - 6)` when the underlying has more than 6 decimals, otherwise `1`.

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.
